/**
 * Calculates the number of documents in the result set of the given query,
 * without actually downloading the documents.
 *
 * Using this function to count the documents is efficient because only the
 * final count, not the documents' data, is downloaded. This function can even
 * count the documents if the result set would be prohibitively large to
 * download entirely (e.g. thousands of documents).
 *
 * The result received from the server is presented, unaltered, without
 * considering any local state. That is, documents in the local cache are not
 * taken into consideration, neither are local modifications not yet
 * synchronized with the server. Previously-downloaded results, if any, are not
 * used: every request using this source necessarily involves a round trip to
 * the server.
 *
 * @param query - The query whose result set size to calculate.
 * @returns A Promise that will be resolved with the count; the count can be
 * retrieved from `snapshot.data().count`, where `snapshot` is the
 * `AggregateQuerySnapshot` to which the returned Promise resolves.
