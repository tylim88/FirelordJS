/**
 * listen to query or single document
 *
 * ======================================
 * listen to query
 * ======================================
 * Attaches a listener for `QuerySnapshot` events. You may either pass
 * individual `onNext` and `onError` callbacks or pass a single observer
 * object with `next` and `error` callbacks. The listener can be cancelled by
 * calling the function that is returned when `onSnapshot` is called.
 *
 * NOTE: Although an `onCompletion` callback can be provided, it will
 * never be called because the snapshot stream is never-ending.
 *
 * @param query - The query to listen to.
 * @param onNext - A callback to be called every time a new `QuerySnapshot`
 * is available.
 * @param onError - optional and skippable(function overloading), a callback to be called if the listen fails or is
 * cancelled. No further callbacks will occur.
 * @param options - optional, options controlling the listen behavior.
 * @returns An unsubscribe function that can be called to cancel
 * the snapshot listener.
 *
 * ======================================
 * listen to a single document
 * ======================================
 * Attaches a listener for `DocumentSnapshot` events. You may either pass
 * individual `onNext` and `onError` callbacks or pass a single observer
 * object with `next` and `error` callbacks.
 *
 * NOTE: Although an `onCompletion` callback can be provided, it will
 * never be called because the snapshot stream is never-ending.
 *
 * @param reference - A reference to the document to listen to.
 * @param onNext - A callback to be called every time a new `DocumentSnapshot`
 * is available.
 * @param onError - optional and skippable(function overloading), a callback to be called if the listen fails or is
 * cancelled. No further callbacks will occur.
 * @param options - optional, an options controlling the listen behavior.
 * @returns An unsubscribe function that can be called to cancel
 * the snapshot listener.
