newly discovered runtime error

1. delete field not on top level of update(dot notation considered as top level) & set
2. merge field path invalid if there is no such field in data
3. merge must be true to delete field 
4. direct array
5. using limitToLast without at least one orderBy (clause order in query doesn't matter)
6. comparing direct array in query (this is prevented naturally by type engine)
7. cursor with has x number of arguments must has at least x number of orderBy clause come before that cursor
8. cannot use more than one '!=' filter (not documented directly or indirectly)
9. When querying a collection group by documentId(), the value provided must result in a valid document path, and should has an odd number of segments (1).
10. When querying a collection by documentId(), you must provide a plain document ID, but 'sandbox/a/b/c' contains a '/' character.

new info 
1. new limit/limitToLast clause will override old limit/limitToLast clause in query
2. new cursor will override old cursor
3. serverTimestamp is possibly null if it haven't resolved https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47771044/firestore-timestamp-getting-null
4. firestore cannot store Nan

limitation
1. unable to union object type with other type except possibly undefined <- not exactly limitation but something that you shouldn't do
3. no autocomplete for where's value.
4. working with documentId and where require to assert the value as const.
5. no Record<number, any>

anything where the input has nothing to do with document data type, is directly exported by FirelordJS without any change, they are:
- loadBundle
- clearIndexedDbPersistence
- connectFirestoreEmulator
- disableNetwork
- enableIndexedDbPersistence
- enableMultiTabIndexedDbPersistence
- enableNetwork
- onSnapshotsInSync
- namedQuery

new features:
1. prevent naked empty array in where clause <-- easy, done
2. stop user from using error message as value <-- easy but need to implement in many place, probably too unnecessary
3. absolute member <-- difficult but can be very useful, for example updateAt timestamp
