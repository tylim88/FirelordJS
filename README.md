FirelordJS is the only library capable of providing insane type safety while exposing almost all the API of the official Firestore SDK.

FirelordJS:

- Has the lowest learning curve (API is nearly identical to the original API).
- Has the lowest technical debt (easy to revert to the official API).
- Offer truly and most generic type safety solutions.
- Offer effortless solutions for [Firestore quirks](https://firelordjs.com/highlights/about).
- **Is the only library capable of [typing against](https://firelordjs.com/highlights/query_rule_typing) Firestore limitations**.
- Has the [smallest](https://firelordjs.com/minified_size) package size.

Support [@firebase/rules-unit-testing and emulator](https://firelordjs.com/guides/tests)

I am confident it has the best type safe and nothing come close. I put money on my words and I will buy you [x cups of coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) if you:

1. found something better: 75 cups
2. created something better: 1000 cups (you don't need to a make full fledge library, something that is minimally better is enough, open an issue if you want to take this challenge)

FirelordJS is thoroughly tested, it tests source code, built files and published package.

No mock test, all tests test against real database and emulator to ensure the highest certainty.

More than 250 tests.

Undocumented releases are README updates.

## Upcoming V3

V3 focus on codebase redesign and rewrite with TS 5.0, hopefully with further improved code quality, potential contributors will find it easier to work with.

Code Quality Improvements:

- More extensible and simpler type logics.
- Implement latest TS features.
- Better files and folders structure.
- Remove trivial APIs. (ongoing improvement since v2.3)
- Less wordy and more concise Documentation.(ongoing improvement since v2.3.1)
- Test, test, test, need MORE Tests.

V3 New Features:

- Auto narrow to literal type, remove the need to [manually assert as const](https://firelordjs.com/highlights/where#const-assertion). Most of this issue was resolved in [v2.3.1](https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJS/releases/tag/2.3.1) (while [v2.3.2](https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJS/releases/tag/2.3.2) resolved accepting const asserted values issues). To solve the rest of the issues, we need [TS 5.0 const type parameter](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0-beta/#const-type-parameters).

- Narrow read type base on query constraint. For example `where('a', '==', true)` will narrow the read type of field `a` to `true`, it should be able to narrow down complex case like `where('a.b.c', '==', { d:[{e:1}] })`. Expected to support `==` comparator for all types and _possibly_ `!=` comparator for literal type(type filtering for`!=` comparator poses great complexity hence I may not work on it).

- Mandatory field update. Example, for field like `updatedAt`, it is mandatory to includes it every time you update the document. There are two ways to implement these feature: via Meta Type and via abstraction. With Meta Type(using special field value), it is less flexible because we no longer able to exclude it from all update operations. With abstraction, it is more flexible but require more works from user. I prefer via abstraction due to it does not shut down other use cases despite having lower user experience.

- Support tuple data type.

- Replace `set merge` with `upset`(update else set, yes I know upset is an English word üòÇ). It receives 1 doc ref argument and 2 data arguments: partial data and complete data. It will attempt to update the document with partial data and create the document with complete data if the document does not exist.

What will not be implemented:

- Support for wide numeric key and wide string key (Record<number, unknown> and Record<string, unknown>). It still needs more consideration because this data type is pointless to query(we need to know what the key is first, it would be better to just save the document ID somewhere) and we need to constantly aware of the document size limit. If you don't care about query and you sure that the size limit will not exceed 1 MB, then this is for you. But allowing this also open up for mistake and bad practice for those who are not aware. Most likely I will not implement this but will give it deeper thoughts in the future.

- Support for object unions type. Objects unions type seem to be a good type to have in NoSQL database because of how ever-changing NoSQL schema is. However, this is not the case because it brings uncertainty that cannot be handled reasonably. For example, with `{a:number}|{b:string}`, you can set `{a:1}` then update `{b:"x"}`, in this case the type is no longer unions type but an intersection type: `{a:number} & {b:string}`. So I will not implement this feature and will remove it from [FireSageJS](https://github.com/tylim88/FireSageJS) too. A better way to solve this is to use [`PossiblyReadAsUndefined`](https://firelordjs.com/guides/possibly_read_as_undefined) label on newly add field instead(you can also label abandoned fields as `PossiblyReadAsUndefined`, but an easier way is to just ignore them totally lol).

- Support for optional (`?` modifier). Optional is a highly requested feature because of how common it is, however because of how Firestore works: it is impossible to query a missing field. Example: it is impossible to query user that has no phone number if phone number field does not exist. Because of this, it is important to make sure every field exists. You may not need the field now, but you may need it later plus adding default value is simple, especially with such powerful typing library like Firelord. So in order to not accidentally cripple your query in the future, I will not implement this feature. Yes, set merge basically lead to the same problem, hence I discourage you from using set merge and will replace set merge with `upset`.
